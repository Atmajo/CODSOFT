            <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span>1897-1921: Early life</span> Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose (née Dutt) and
                    Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack—in what is today the state of Odisha in India, but was
                    then the Orissa Division of Bengal Province in British India.[ag][ah] Prabhavati, or familiarly Mā
                    jananī, the anchor of family life, had her first child at age 14 and 13 children
                    thereafter. Subhas was the ninth child and the sixth son.[54] Jankinath, a successful lawyer and
                    government pleader,[53] was loyal to the government of British India and scrupulous about matters of
                    language and the law. A self-made man from the rural outskirts of Calcutta, he had remained in touch
                    with his roots, returning annually to his village during the pooja holidays</li>

                <li><span>1921–1932: Indian National Congress</span> Subhas Bose, aged 24, arrived ashore in India at
                    Bombay on the morning of 16 July 1921 and immediately set about arranging an interview with Mahatma
                    Gandhi. Gandhi, aged 51, was the leader of the non-cooperation movement that had taken India by
                    storm the previous year and in a quarter-century would evolve to secure its independence.Gandhi
                    happened to be in Bombay and agreed to see Bose that afternoon. In Bose's account of the
                    meeting, written many years later, he pilloried Gandhi with question after question. Bose
                    thought Gandhi's answers were vague, his goals unclear, his plan for achieving them not thought
                    through. Gandhi and Bose differed in this first meeting on the question of means—for Gandhi
                    non-violent means to any end were non-negotiable; in Bose's thought, all means were acceptable in
                    the service of anti-colonial ends. They differed on the question of ends—Bose was attracted to
                    totalitarian models of governance, which were anathematized by Gandhi. According to historian
                    Gordon, "Gandhi, however, set Bose on to the leader of the Congress and Indian nationalism in
                    Bengal, C. R. Das, and in him Bose found the leader whom he sought." Das was more flexible than
                    Gandhi, more sympathetic to the extremism that had attracted idealistic young men such as Bose in
                    Bengal.</li>
                <li><span>1933–1937: Illness, Austria, Emilie Schenkl</span> During the mid-1930s Bose travelled in
                    Europe, visiting Indian students and European politicians, including Benito Mussolini. He observed
                    party organisation and saw communism and fascism in action. In this period, he also researched
                    and wrote the first part of his book The Indian Struggle, which covered the country's independence
                    movement in the years 1920–1934. Although it was published in London in 1935, the British government
                    banned the book in the colony out of fears that it would encourage unrest. Bose was supported in
                    Europe by the Indian Central European Society organized by Otto Faltis from Vienna.</li>
                <li><span>1941: Escape to Nazi Germany</span> Bose's arrest and subsequent release set the scene for his
                    escape to Nazi Germany, via Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. A few days before his escape, he
                    sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard. Late night 16
                    January 1941, the night of his escape, he dressed as a Pathan (brown long coat, a black fez-type
                    coat and broad pyjamas) to avoid being identified. Bose escaped from under British surveillance from
                    his Elgin Road house in Calcutta on the night of 17 January 1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir
                    Kumar Bose, later reaching Gomoh Railway Station (now Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Gomoh Station) in
                    the then state of Bihar (now Jharkhand), India.</li>

            <h2>18 August 1945: Death</h2>
            <p>The death of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose has been a myth, some says his death occurred from third-degree
                burns on 18 August 1945 after his overloaded Japanese plane crashed in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now
                Taiwan) and some says he didn't die out of plane accident he was alive afterwards as an old monk.</p>
